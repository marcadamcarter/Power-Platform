# Scenario 2: Moving from a single production environment 
This scenario aims at users or organizations that have a single Dataverse environment with a database that they use to create, test, and deploy
their apps. Having a single environment poses challenges in terms of change
management and control.

To move to healthy application lifecycle management (ALM), you must:

1.  Separate your development and production environments, at a minimum. The ideal solution is to have three environments, one each for development, testing, and production/deployment.

2.  Use solutions to ship changes across environments: More information: [Use a solution to customize](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/use-solutions-for-your-customizations)

3.  Automate the application lifecycle process using DevOps. More information: [Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools for Azure DevOps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools)
